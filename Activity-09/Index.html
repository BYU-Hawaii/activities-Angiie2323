        <h2> Interesting fact</h2>
        <img src="chocolatechipcookies.jpg" alt="Baked cookies ">
          <p> Accidental Invention: The chocolate chip cookie was created by accident when Ruth Wakefield ran out of baker's chocolate and substituted it with broken pieces of semi-sweet chocolate, expecting them to melt and disperse through the dough.
            Instead, the chocolate held its shape, creating the beloved chocolate chip cookie.</p>   
        
        <p>Cookies hold a special place in our hearts and kitchens, serving as a sweet symbol of comfort and joy. 
        They embody a sense of nostalgia, often reminding us of childhood memories spent baking with loved ones or receiving a warm, homemade batch fresh from the oven.
        Each bite of a cookie can evoke feelings of happiness and warmth, making them more than just a treat, but a cherished tradition passed down through generations. 
        Whether enjoyed with a glass of milk, shared with friends and family, or left out for Santa Claus, cookies have an uncanny ability to bring people together and make moments feel magical.</p>
